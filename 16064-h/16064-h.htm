<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">

<p>In a continent but recently settled, many parts of which have as yet
little historical or cultural background, the material for this volume
has been gathered from a section that was one of the first to be
colonized. Here the Frenchman, Spaniard, and Englishman all passed,
leaving each his legend; and a brilliant and more or less feudal
civilization with its aristocracy and slaves has departed with the
economic system upon which it rested.</p>

<p>From this medley of early colonial discovery and romance, from the
memories of war and reconstruction, it has been as difficult to choose
coherently as to maintain restraint in selection among the many
grotesque negro legends and superstitions so rich in imagery and music.
Coupled with this there has been another task; that of keeping these
legends and stories in their natural matrix, the semi-tropical landscape
of the <i>Low Country</i>, which somehow lends them all a pensively
melancholy yet fitting background. Not to have so portrayed them, would
have been to sacrifice their essentially local tang. To the reader
unfamiliar with coastal Carolina, the unique aspects of its landscapes
may seem exaggerated in <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>these pages; the observant visitor and the
native will, it is hoped, recognize that neither the colors nor the
shadows are too strong. These poems, however, are not local only, they
are stories and pictures of a chapter of American history little known,
but dramatic and colorful, and in the relation of an important part to
the whole they may carry a decided interest to the country at large.</p>

<p>Local color has a fatal tendency to remain local; but it is also true
that the universal often borders on the void. It has been said, perhaps
wisely, that the immediate future of American Poetry lies rather in the
intimate feeling of local poets who can interpret their own sections to
the rest of the country as Robinson and Frost have done so nobly for New
England, rather than in the effort to <i>yawp</i> universally. Hence there is
no attempt here to say, "O New York, O Pennsylvania," but simply, "O
Carolina."</p>

<p>The South, however, has been "interpreted" so often, either with
condescending pity or nauseous sentimentality, that it is the aim of
this book to speak simply and carefully amid a babel of unauthentic
utterance. Nevertheless, the contents of this volume do not pretend to
exact historical accuracy; this is poetry rather than history, although
the legends and facts upon which it rests have been gathered with much
painstaking research and careful verification. It should be kept in mind
that these poems are <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>impressionistic attempts to present the fleeting
feeling of the moment, landscape moods, and the ephemeral attitudes of
the past. Legends are material to be moulded, and not facts to be
recorded. Above all here is no pretence of propaganda.</p>

<p>As some of the material touched on is not accessible in standard
reference, prose notes have been included giving the historical facts or
background of legend upon which a poem has been based. These notes
together with a bibliography will be found at the back of the volume.</p>

<p>If the only result of this book is to call attention to the literary and
artistic values inherent in the South, and to the essentially unique and
yet nationally interesting qualities of the Carolina Low Country, its
landscapes and legends, the labor bestowed here will have secured its
harvest.</p>

<h2><a name="MAGNOLIA_GARDENS" id="MAGNOLIA_GARDENS"></a>MAGNOLIA GARDENS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Prose-Poem</span></h3>


<p>In the spring when the first midges dance and warm days lure the
last-year's butterfly, the scarlet of the cardinals begins to flicker
through the ivory smoke of the mosses. Then the alligator leaves his
winter ooze, and the widening "O" of the ripple which his gar-like nose
makes, travels slowly across the sullen ponds, where the pendant
gonfalons of the mosses kiss their imaginary duplicates, hanging head
downward in the red water.</p>

<p>When the first frog honks with the bull-voiced trumpet of resurgent
spring, the jasmine rings its little hawk-bells, golden harp notes
through the forest; and the usurping wistaria assumes the purple,
reigning imperial and alone, flaunting its <i>palidementum</i> in a cascade
of lilac amid the matrix of the mosses. Its sleek, muscular vine-arms
writhe round the clasped bodies of live oaks as if two lovers slept
beneath a cloak, and the cloisonn&eacute; pavilion of their dalliance drips a
blue-glaze of shadows overhead.</p>

<p>Underneath this motley canopy of gray and blue, lush with the early
tenderness of leaves, the pink <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>azaleas open light-shy eyes like pupils
of albinos, sloughing off delicate pods that smoulder, when the wind
blows, live coals among the gray of furnace ashes. Here are magenta
carpets fit for leprechauns, when crescent moons glimmer upon the ocher
ponds, and the slow fireflies light their phantom lanterns, weaving to
and fro about the ivory-orange marble of the tomb.</p>

<p>Each April day brings opalescent waves of birds that dart like living
brands about the aisles to light the flower lamps; nonpareils, orioles,
and hummingbirds, a mist of speed upon their wings, while the blue heron
stands one-legg&eacute;d by the ponds, watching the garden till it seethes and
flames with colors from the cloaks of mandarins.</p>

<p>High in the ancient forest the magnolias burn the perfect alban lucence
of their lamps; white are their ivory cups like priestly linen, and
fragrant with the tang of foreign citrons. An esoteric, mirrored swan
slides by like Cleopatra's barge, while drums of color beaten by a
maniac blend with old tints of Leonardo's dreams, colors that God might
see if his own lightning blasted out his eyes.</p>

<p>This march of color chants a strange barbaric fitness of dithyrambic
chords, and moves processional <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>across the days like some encarnadined
durbar, where a huge Ethiopian eunuch in red moon-shaped slippers and an
orange turban walks with a glittering scimetar, leading a brace of
sleepy leopards drugged and golden eyed; the caparisoned elephants swing
down a latticed street; silk shawls hang from balconies, brushing the
domed gilt of howdahs; and ruby-roped, the maharajahs sway behind the
mahout with his peavey-goad.</p>

<p>The stark denial of the blue-ribbed sky looks down upon this garden,
where the wantonness of earth is flaunted in the spring against the face
of heaven's void sterility. Here stolid faces look ashamed. When the sun
leans on boreal wings, there is a month that lovers walk here justified,
while flower throats cry in vast choirs, "Glory to life!" and the
uplifted trumpets of vine tubas shout with noise of color set to notes
of bloom.</p>

<p>The bells of Charleston, like the bells of London Town, have a peculiar
interest. St. Michael's bells and clock were brought from England in
1764. When the British evacuated Charleston in 1782 they took the bells
with them. A Mr. Ryhineu bought them in England and returned them. They
were rehung in November, 1783. During the Civil War, St. Michael's
steeple was the target for Federal artillery and fleet guns. In 1861 the
bells were taken to Columbia, S.C., where two of them were stolen, and
the rest injured by fire when the city was burned. Those left were again
sent to England, and recast in the original moulds. In March, 1867, they
once again rang out from the spire.</p>

<p>St. Phillip's Church stands in the old part of the town. During the
Civil War its bells were cast into cannon. For a long time its steeple
was used as a lighthouse. It is the center of forgotten things.</p>

<p>The bells of St. Matthew's are modern and speak of <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>a new order, but all
the bells are the voice of the town. They speak for her silences, which
are eloquent.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_ON_THE_PIRATES" id="NOTE_ON_THE_PIRATES"></a>NOTE ON "THE PIRATES"</p>

<p>The many inlets and sheltering coves of the Carolina coasts very early
made the "low country" seaboard a rendezvous for pirates and a shelter
to refit, and to bury their treasure.</p>

<p>As early as 1565 the French from Ribault's settlement succumbed to the
temptation to plunder their rich Spanish neighbors; and in the century
before the coming of the English, the lonely bays and estuaries saw
strange ships from time to time. There was a pirate settlement by 1664
at Cape Fear River, where Governor Sayle did not arrive until 1670 to
take formal possession for the Lords Proprietors of the colony.</p>

<p>The Peace of Utrecht turned many privateers into pirates, ships which
had been habitually preying upon Spanish commerce since Blake's victory
at Santa Cruz in 1657, and these gentlemen of fortune were at first
welcome in the Carolinas. Nearly all the coin in circulation then was at
first brought by such doubtful adventurers, and they were regarded as
the natural protectors of the Carolinas against their powerful enemy,
the Spaniard, to the south.</p>

<p><!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>Gradually, however, this cordial attitude changed. It was a small step
from attacking Spanish to plundering English commerce, and with the
cultivation and export of rice and indigo, the demand for a safe sea
passage grew overwhelming, while the coasts continued to be ravaged. The
royal government was slow to act. In 1684 we learn that "the governor
will not in all probability always reside in Charles Town, which is so
near the sea as to be in danger of sudden attack by pirates;" nor was
this an idle thought, for the town was blockaded by pirate ships at the
harbor's mouth, and medicines and supplies demanded while citizens were
held as hostages.</p>

<p>In 1718 Governor Spotswood of Virginia sent an expedition to North
Carolina, which succeeded in surprising, capturing, and beheading the
notorious "Black Beard," who in company with one Stede Bonnet, had long
ravaged the coast with impunity.</p>

<p>In August of the same year word was brought to Charlestown that Bonnet
with his ship the <i>Royal James</i> was refitting in the Cape Fear River.
Colonel William Rhett volunteered to attack him. With two sloops of
eight guns each, the <i>Henry</i> and the <i>Nymph</i>, and about 130 men in all,
he set sail, and found Bonnet at anchor in the Cape Fear River. In
making the attack, and during the encounter, all three ships ran
aground. The fight raged desperately all day between the <i>Henry</i> and the
<i>Royal James</i>, <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>the <i>Nymph</i> being unable to get off the shoal and come
to the help of her companion ship. Bonnet finally surrendered and was
taken prisoner to Charlestown. It is this adventure which the poem
celebrates.</p>

<p>Bonnet escaped, but was afterwards recaptured by Colonel Rhett on
Sullivan's Island. He and about thirty of his crew were hanged about the
corner of Meeting and Water Streets. Bonnet, himself, was hanged later
than his crew, after a masterpiece of invective by the judge, who
painted hell vividly. This pirate leader was dragged fainting to the
gallows, and there was much sympathy for him, as it was said, "His humor

<p>The Seewee Indians, who lived on the shores of what is now known as
Bull's Bay, S.C., but was formerly called Seewee Bay, became
discontented with the small prices obtained from the white traders for
pelts. Seeing the ships constantly coming into the Bay from England,
they conceived the idea of building large canoes and reaching England
over the ocean. Several huge canoes, larger than any hereto<!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>fore built
by Indians, were accordingly constructed; these were loaded with the
proceeds of a season's hunting, and, manned by all the braves of the
tribe, set out in the direction from which the ships came. A gale came
up and the braves were never seen again. Their squaws gradually wandered
off to other tribes. This event took place about 1696.</p>

<p>The Marquis de la Fayette, under the name of Gilbert du Motier, sailed
from Bordeaux on the 26th of March, 1777, accompanied by the Baron Kalb
and several French Army Officers. On the 14th of June, 1777, he first
landed in America on North Island in Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, S.C.,
and was received at the house of Major Huger. In a letter to his wife,
written soon after his landing, La Fayette says, "I first saw and judged
of the life of the country at the house of a Major Huger." Detailed
accounts of La Fayette's landing and reception still exist.</p><p><!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">To Accompany "The Priest and the Pirate"</span></p>

<p>In 1801 Theodosia, daughter of Aaron Burr, Vice-President of the United
States, married Joseph Alston of "The Oaks," Hobcaw Barony, S.C. They
had one son, Aaron Burr Alston, who died in 1812, the same year that
Joseph Alston was elected Governor of the State. On December 30th, 1812,
at the urgent solicitation of her father, who had just returned from
Europe, and who awaited her eagerly in New York, Theodosia set sail from
Georgetown, S.C., in the pilot-boat schooner, "Patriot." Those on board
were never seen again.</p>

<p>The vessel, which was being fitted out as a privateer, was carrying
dismounted guns under her deck, and may have foundered in the severe
gale of January 1st, 1813.</p>

<p>In 1869, however, a Dr. W.C. Pool attended a fisher family at Naggs
Head, Kittyhawk, N.C. In the fisherman's hut hung an oil painting of a
beautiful woman, which had been taken from an abandoned pilot-built
schooner that drifted onto the North Carolina coast in that vicinity in
January, 1813. No one was aboard and the vessel had evidently been
looted. Ladies' clothes were found in great disorder in the cabin.</p>

<p><!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>There was also a story told by a dying sailor who confessed that he had
seen the crew of such a boat walk the plank, and that among them was a
beautiful woman who walked into the sea with a Bible or prayer-book in
her hand.</p>

<p>The painting is in the possession of the Burr-Alston connection, and is
thought by them, on account of its striking family resemblance, to be a
picture of Theodosia Burr. The painting story has often been scouted,
but there is too much circumstantial evidence to ignore it in treating
the legend.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_TO_THE_LAST_CREW" id="NOTE_TO_THE_LAST_CREW"></a>NOTE TO "THE LAST CREW"</p>

<p>The "Fish-Boat" of the Confederate Navy, which exhaustive research
indicates to have been the first submarine vessel to sink an enemy ship
in time of war, was designed by Horace L. Hundley in 1863. This boat was
twenty feet long, three and one-half feet wide, and five feet deep. Her
motive power consisted of eight men whose duty it was to turn the crank
of the propeller shaft by hand until the target had been reached. When
this primitive craft was closed for diving there was only sufficient air
to support life for half an hour. Since the torpedo was attached to the
boat itself there was no chance of escape. The only hope was to reach
and destroy the <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>enemy vessel before the crew were suffocated or
drowned.</p>

<p>Five successive volunteer crews died without reaching their objectives.
But the sixth crew was successful in sinking the Federal blockading ship
"Housatonic," their own craft being caught and crushed beneath the
foundering vessel. These crews went to certain death in the night time,
in such secrecy that it was often months before their own families knew
the names of the men. And now, with the lapse of scarcely more than half
a century, it has been possible to find the names of only sixteen of
those who paid the price.</p>

<p>Because no nation of any time can point to a more inspiring example of
self-sacrifice, and because now, in a country reunited and indissoluble,
the traditions of both the North and the South are a common, glorious
heritage, the poem, which presents the final episode in the drama, is
written as a memorial to all who gave their lives in the venture.</p>

<p>In May, 1828, Poe enlisted in the army under the name of Edgar A. Perry,
and was assigned to Battery<!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a  name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span> "H" of the First Artillery at Fort
Independence. In October his battery was ordered to Fort Moultrie,
Charleston, S.C. Poe spent a whole year on Sullivan's Island. Professor
C. Alphonso Smith, the well-known Poe authority, says, "So far as I
know, this was the only tropical background that Poe had ever seen."
That the susceptible nature of the young poet was vastly impressed by
the weirdness and melancholy scenery of the Carolina coast country,
there can be very little doubt. The dank tarns and funereal woodlands of
his landscapes, or at least the strong suggestion of them, may all be
found here, and the scene of <i>The Goldbug</i> is definitely laid on
Sullivan's Island. Here are dim family vaults, and tracts of country in
which the House of Usher might well stand.</p>

his second volume in 1829. There are later echoes.</p>

<p>"Marsh Tackies" is the name given by the negroes to the little, wild
horses of the Carolina coast country's swamps and sea islands. Early
traditions say that these horses were found by the English when they
first came and that they are the descendants of runaways from the
Spanish settlements to the South about St. Augustine, or horses turned
loose by DeSoto upon his ill-fated march to the Mississippi. These
horses pick up a precarious living in out-of-the-way sections along the
coast, and are occasionally taken and broken in by the negroes. They are
the "poor horse trash" of the section.</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
